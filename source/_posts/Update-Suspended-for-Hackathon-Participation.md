Dear ApisOps Community and Esteemed Readers,

As an operating system developer who is passionate about software architecture and cloud infrastructure, I'm excited to announce that I will participate in a hackathon held by OpenD/I in Sydney commencing on 5 December. As a team leader, a software architect, and a back-end engineer, I need to allocate my full attention to this event, especially in the first several days.

As a consequence, there will be a suspension of updates on this website until 8 December. The development process for ApisOps will also continue from this day on.

However, our solution for this hackathon will be open-source, and it will be available on [this repository](https://github.com/classmateada/open-di-hackathon) on 5 December. You can track our work through this repository if you like.

I greatly appreciate your understanding and support during this period. I'm eager to bring back content about ApisOps, algorithms, and software design after we fully understand the problem and make a complete scaffold for our solution.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused. Thank you for your continued support!

Ada
