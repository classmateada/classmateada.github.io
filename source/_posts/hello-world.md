# A destroyed "game account"

Do you have such an experience: you destroy your character or account in a game, so you must create a new character or register a new account and start from zero? I had such an experience, but the thing that I destroyed was not my character or account in a game; it was my life.

In 2022, I've chosen Golang as the programming language that I mostly use and Site Reliability Engineer as my job. I didn't know that that was the worst decision I've made in my life. That doesn't mean Golang is a terrible language or that SRE is a bad job for a programmer. They are just not suitable for a fresh graduate. You probably know that the status of a fresh graduate is really important in China because there's a special opportunity for fresh graduates to be hired by companies in China regardless of work experience. But SRE is a job that requires a lot of experience, and Golang is a new programming language that also requires 3-5 years of experience in other languages. So, it's really hard for a programmer who doesn't have more than 3 years of experience to become a SRE using Golang in China; the chances are really limited.

Fortunately, I finally got a job at a big international company as a SRE with a satisfactory salary. I worked hard, developed a lot of important features, solved many complicated bugs alone, and became an indispensable member of the SRE team. That's the happiest 8 months of my life: my job became a part of my life, I live in a big city where everything is convenient and enjoyable, and I never need to work overtime. I feel happy every time I remember that time.

The good times didn't last long. I've lost my job because my department and group were abolished due to the company's poor decision-making. I tried to find a new job as an SRE and asked over 400 companies, but I wasn't given a single chance to interview because I only have 8 months of experience and I'm not a fresh graduate anymore. I was rejected by every company simply because of my experience, regardless of my strong programming skills and my ability to work as an experienced programmer.

# Review my mistakes

I'm used to reviewing my mistakes when I know I've done something wrong, so I started thinking about why I failed just after I lost my job. A lot of my friends told me, "It's not your fault; it's due to the abnormal circumstances." But I couldn't agree with that because the root cause of this failure was that I'd chosen the wrong job and the inappropriate programming language for a fresh graduate. I think that kind of opinion is as silly as using a C++ compiler to compile Golang source codes, getting a "compilation failed", and then complaining that the compiler is difficult to use. Anyway, I must change my programming language and ideal job.

I chose C++ and operating system development after careful consideration. The main reason is that C++ is a widely used programming language compared with Golang. Besides, operating system developers are required by a lot of big companies, but the demand exceeds the supply because it's boring and too difficult for most programmers. I also know that it's easy for operating system developers to change their jobs to driver developers, embedded system developers, kernel developers, or C++ back-end developers. But there was still a question remaining: I need a job and more than 3 years of experience.

I've made up my mind to get the status of a fresh graduate again by studying overseas to avoid the restriction of experience. That's the easiest and most stable way, I think. I can also upgrade my education level to postgraduate by doing this, which may give me more chances to get a satisfactory job.

# Restart my life

Unexpectedly, I got a chance to work as an outsourcing software engineer in the Department of OpenHarmony at Huawei. It's a good job and an unforgettable experience, but I need to work overtime until 9 p.m. more than three times a week, and I usually need to work on Saturdays. So I didn't change my decision to study overseas.

I submitted some applications to Australian and New Zealand universities while working. Fortunately, I got some satisfactory offers and accepted one of them. All right, you all know what happened next: My life restarted successfully.

# Epilog

There are still a lot of things to do, like completing my course, applying for a summer internship, and improving my speaking English skills to communicate with locals. But I feel more confident than before because I've regained control of my life.
