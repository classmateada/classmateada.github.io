## What's this website for?

This is my personal website, which was originally created for sharing my notes and the process of troubleshooting. The purpose of creating such a website is to prevent myself from forgetting what I know or making the same mistakes again, and to help others avoid making the same mistakes I did.

Please note that this is not a tech blog. At most times, I will post some articles and notes about software development and software design here. I'll regularly post something not related to technology here as well.

This is a static website that is based on [Hexo](https://hexo.io), open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com), and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
